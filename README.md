# ERP Exploration Project: Odoo vs. SAP

## Summary

This project explores and compares two major ERP systems: Odoo and SAP. The aim is to understand their functionalities, usability, and differences by creating a series of YouTube videos that cover various tasks and features within each system. The project provides an in-depth analysis of how each ERP system handles tasks like RFQ creation, sales order processing, website integration, and Point of Sale (POS) usage. The comparative analysis is supplemented with personal learning experiences shared through video content.
